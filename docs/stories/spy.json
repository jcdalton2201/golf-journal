Pulling up to the clubhouse, you might miss it. It is small but has all the things     you need to get started. The day we played, there was a dense marine layer in the area. The first hole begins on top     of the hill and drifts down and to the left to the sea. Now you can see the ocean for the next four holes.  These are     some of the more memorable holes on the course, including the fun 4th. The 4th is a short par four with a long thin     green that slopes away from you.  A missed place tee shot or a lousy approach will cause you to bogie this hole.</div></div><div class='section1'><picture><source media='(min-width: 700px)' data-lazy-srcset='images/spy1-1250.webp 1x' alt='TGJ Podcast'property='contentUrl' srcset='images/spy1-1250.webp 1x'><source media='(max-width: 700px)' data-lazy-srcset='images/spy1-350.webp 1x, images/spy1-700.webp 2x'alt='TGJ Podcast' property='contentUrl' srcset='images/spy1-350.webp 1x, images/spy1-700.webp2x'><img class='rocket-lazyload lazyloaded' data-lazy-src='images/spy1-700.webp' alt=''property='contentUrl' src='images/spy1-700.webp' data-was-processed='true'></picture><div class='text'>    Travel to the ocean then back again.</div></div><div class='section2'><div class='text ts2' data-ref='ts2'>    After four holes by the ocean, it is now time to travel back inland. The rest of the course is a winding journey through the pine trees. If you been North Caroline or East Texas pines, you will recognize this course. While you have plenty of room on the fairways, you will have to place your shots carefully to have any chance on your approach shots. The rough is a no go on most days as all you can do is just hope to get back to the fairway. I would recommend a caddy and walking the course over to get a cart. Spyglass is a cart path only course, and the walk from the path to the fairway is always an up, down, up, down, walk. Plus, the knowledge of the caddies does make the rounds so much enjoyable. I would still take Pebble Beach over Spyglass, but this is one of the top courses in the world.</div></div><div class='section1'><picture><source media='(min-width: 700px)' data-lazy-srcset='images/spy5-1250.webp 1x' alt='TGJ Podcast'property='contentUrl' srcset='images/spy5-1250.webp 1x'><source media='(max-width: 700px)' data-lazy-srcset='images/spy5-350.webp 1x, images/spy5-700.webp 2x'alt='TGJ Podcast' property='contentUrl' srcset='images/spy5-350.webp 1x, images/spy5-700.webp2x'><img class='rocket-lazyload lazyloaded' data-lazy-src='images/spy5-700.webp' alt=''property='contentUrl' src='images/spy5-700.webp' data-was-processed='true'></picture></div></div>",
